# HTML-Website-Practice
A static website built using HTML only, featuring a fictional CV set in the universe of Cyberpunk 2077.
## 📌 Project Purpose
The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of core HTML concepts by building a complete webpage from scratch. I intentionally limited the project to HTML only to focus on structure, semantics, and media embedding.
## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
- **Semantic HTML structure** - Organized content using proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) and structured sections to create a readable CV layout.
- **Media integration** - Embedded a video background using the `<video>` element and added a custom favicon using the `<link>` tag.
- **Content organization** - Designed a fictional character CV with clear sections such as profile, experience, and attributes.
- **Static site deployment** - Published the website using GitHub Pages, demonstrating basic Git and repository management skills.
